The TF 1.x summary API cannot be automatically migrated to TF 2.0, so symbols have been converted to tf.compat.v1.summary.* and must be migrated manually. Typical usage will only require changes to the summary writing logic, not to individual calls like scalar(). For examples of the new summary API, see the Effective TF 2.0 migration document or check the TF 2.0 TensorBoard tutorials.\n","INFO line 116:34: Renamed 'tf.summary.FileWriter' to 'tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter'\n","INFO line 120:24: Renamed 'tf.global_variables_initializer' to 'tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer'\n","INFO line 121:24: Renamed 'tf.Session' to 'tf.compat.v1.Session'\n","INFO line 125:25: Renamed 'tf.train.Saver' to 'tf.compat.v1.train.Saver'\n","TensorFlow 2.0 Upgrade Script\n","-----------------------------\n","Converted 1 files\n","Detected 1 issues that require attention\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","File: DQNPlayer.py\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","DQNPlayer.py:66:26: ERROR: Using member tf.contrib.layers.flatten in deprecated module tf.contrib. tf.contrib.layers.flatten cannot be converted automatically. tf.contrib will not be distributed with TensorFlow 2.0, please consider an alternative in non-contrib TensorFlow, a community-maintained repository such as tensorflow/addons, or fork the required code.\n","\n","\n","Make sure to read the detailed log 'report.txt'\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"K22v_sFvi-Gr","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Now train poker AI"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vDKGc92Zi9gC","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":32},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1597343945954,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":245,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Fielding","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhSN4LFCsErBB1WklhXbGScbGxwOI3nxi2NnqWY1A=s64","userId":"18194361060124911983"}},"outputId":"98db147c-f220-4b0b-8549-fb1ec78a67ef"},"source":["cd src/EvgenyScripts/"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/content/drive/My Drive/PokerRLModels/poker-RL/src/EvgenyScripts\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mERZGCtWjIE_","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1597350028542,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":2047808,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Fielding","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhSN4LFCsErBB1WklhXbGScbGxwOI3nxi2NnqWY1A=s64","userId":"18194361060124911983"}},"outputId":"cc3d85c5-a615-41dc-df5a-e41aabfce51b"},"source":["!python trainingTFV2.py"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["2020-08-13 18:41:08.550918: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:48] Successfully opened dynamic library libcudart.so.10.1\n","WARNING:tensorflow:From /content/drive/My Drive/PokerRLModels/poker-RL/src/EvgenyScripts/DQNPlayer.py:63: conv2d (from tensorflow.python.keras.legacy_tf_layers.convolutional) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n","Instructions for updating:\n","Use `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` instead.\n","WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/legacy_tf_layers/convolutional.py:424: Layer.apply (from tensorflow.python.keras.engine.base_layer_v1) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n","Instructions for updating:\n","Please use `layer.__call__` method instead.\n","WARNING:tensorflow:From /content/drive/My Drive/PokerRLModels/poker-RL/src/EvgenyScripts/DQNPlayer.py:69: flatten (from tensorflow.python.keras.legacy_tf_layers.core) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n","Instructions for updating:\n","Use keras.layers.Flatten instead.\n","WARNING:tensorflow:From /content/drive/My Drive/PokerRLModels/poker-RL/src/EvgenyScripts/DQNPlayer.py:70: dropout (from tensorflow.python.keras.legacy_tf_layers.core) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n","Instructions for updating:\n","Use keras.layers.dropout instead.\n","WARNING:tensorflow:From /content/drive/My Drive/PokerRLModels/poker-RL/src/EvgenyScripts/DQNPlayer.py:72: dense (from tensorflow.python.keras.legacy_tf_layers.core) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n","Instructions for updating:\n","Use keras.layers.Dense instead.\n","2020-08-13 18:41:10.810944: I tensorflow/core/platform/profile_utils/cpu_utils.cc:104] CPU Frequency: 2300000000 Hz\n","2020-08-13 18:41:10.811260: I tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/service.cc:168] XLA service 0x2e68bc0 initialized for platform Host (this does not guarantee that XLA will be used).
